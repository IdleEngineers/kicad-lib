Stavros' KiCad components
=========================

These are just my KiCad components. I haven't tested them, I haven't printed
them, I just made them in KiCad to try and print some PCBs. Pull
requests/additions very welcome!

Contains:
* A PIR motion sensor, like [this
  one](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/images/PIR-motion-sensor-pinout.png),
but my pins seem to be reversed. I think I got a defective batch.
* A [NodeMCU
  0.9](http://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NodeMCU_v0.9_Pinout.png),
the one that takes up a whole breadboard.
* A [photoresistor
  module](http://hobbycomponents.com/sensors/160-photoresistive-light-dependent-resistor-module-ky-018),
  which I also think has the pins wired nonstandardly.

Enjoy, no guarantees, etc!
